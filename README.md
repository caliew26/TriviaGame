Welcome to Seattle Trivia, if you so choose to take the challeng you will have 30 seconds per question and five questions to answer.  

We'll see how much you really know about Seattle.

This is the project I am most proud of to date; I was able to work through arrays, jQuery, establishing a countdown, keeping track of wins/loses.

The challenge for this game was to get an understanding of jQuery; the game.js file is nothing but jQuery. The fun part was seeing how I could hide and unhide things just by using certain key words and how that in the right place you can really manipulate the program.
